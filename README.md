# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

Features:
Interactive Dashboard: Explore a dynamic dashboard with search, sort, and highlight functionalities. Highlighted cars are saved to Local Storage for easy access, and a convenient scroll-to-top feature enhances navigation.
Highlighted Cars Gallery: View your curated collection of highlighted cars on a dedicated page. Easily manage your selections with the option to remove cars directly from this gallery.
Comprehensive Statistics: Dive into detailed statistics with tables showcasing the number of cars and their values by brand and model. Visual insights are provided through interactive pie3 charts and stacked bar graphs.
About Us: Learn more about the vision and goals behind our project on the About Page.
Contact & Feedback: Connect with us and share your feedback on the Contact Page. User reviews and feedback are stored in Local Storage for continuous improvement.
